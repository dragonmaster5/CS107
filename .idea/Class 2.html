<b>Character Entities :</b> are used to produce character in a webpage that you can't just type into the HTML file in your code editor. <br>
e.g: &#169: or &copy;
 <br>

#160 for a space, and #169 for &copy;
<br>
<b>use '#' for numeric codes and no '#' when using the human recognizable version </b> <br>

this is an example of non-breaking &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; space.<br>

cat dog. <br>
cat&#160dog.
if you don't want dog to be pushed across the line limit place a nonbreaking space.
