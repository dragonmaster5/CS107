<h>Bytes and bits</h>
<p><b>Bits:</b> these are the smallest unit of information usually thought of as 0,1 in binary. <br> They are stored on a chip as electrical charge. 0 being negative and 1 being positive.<br>
<b>Byte:</b> There are 8 bits in one of these, it is the smallest unit of storage in a computer.  one packet of information that is smaller than 8 bits will be stored in a single byte, that overflows is stored in a another byte.
<br> ASCII: American Standard for Information Interchange: Only a 128 characters, which are represented by 7 bits. Since 7 bits has 2^7 combinations.
given the left over bit there are 128 characters still on the table. </p>
