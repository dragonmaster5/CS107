<h1>CSCI 107 - <i>My CS Portfoilio</i></h1>
<p>I want to use this&nbsp;website&nbsp;to&nbsp;illustrate&nbsp;many of the personal projects I've created over my time in Lake Forest. <b>
  These are things that are currently buried in my private github, and I would like to be able to show them to possible employers.</b>

</p>

<p>
  These programs include many <mark>cryptographic encoders and decoders</mark> functions, and some home made tools for <mark> statistical analyisis</mark>.
